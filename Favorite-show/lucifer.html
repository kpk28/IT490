                      Season 3<p> 
                          Lucifer (Tom Ellis) wakes up in the middle of the desert with his wings, and later asks Chloe (Lauren German)
                           for help to find out what happened to him. As the season progresses, Lucifer goes to great lengths to figure 
                           out who kidnapped him and why, while also helping the LAPD solve cases that include murdered comedians, serial 
                           killers, and death in a casino. Meanwhile, Amenadiel (D.B. Woodside) tries to adjust to his new life; and Maze 
                           (Lesley-Ann Brandt) discovers that being a bounty hunter might not be enough for her anymore. 
                           The big moment from the Season 3 finale was the one between Lucifer and his 
                           longtime crimefighting/almost romantic partner Det. Chloe Decker (Lauren German) find the true reality of Lucifer.</p>

                                    With Chloe having an issue with seeing Lucifer’s true self, knowing him calling himself the 
                                    devil isn’t a joke, she struggles with accepting who he really is. Because of that, Lucifer 
                                    spends quite a few episodes feeling down about that rejection, at least until Eve shows up.
                                    Yes from biblil Adam and eve. Lucifer being connected to the prophecy
                                    makes everyone shook as it could mean the end of the world.
